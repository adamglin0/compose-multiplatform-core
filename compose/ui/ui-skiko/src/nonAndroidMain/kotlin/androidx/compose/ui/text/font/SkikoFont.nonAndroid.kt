/**
 * Font for use on Skiko-based platforms (Desktop, iOS, macOS, Web).
 *
 * All [SkikoFont] produce an [org.jetbrains.skia.Typeface] which may be used to draw text.
 * This is the main low-level API for introducing a new Font description to Compose on
 * Skiko-based platforms for both blocking and async load.
 *
 * You may subclass this to add new types of font descriptions that may be used in
 * [FontListFontFamily]. For example, you can add a [FontLoadingStrategy.Blocking] font that returns
 * a Typeface from a local resource not supported by an existing [Font]. Or, you can create an
 * [FontLoadingStrategy.Async] font that loads a font file from a server.
 *
 * Subclasses should implement [equals] and [hashCode] based on the values that uniquely identify
 * the font (typically [identity], [weight], [style], [loadingStrategy], and [variationSettings]).
 * Prefer globally unique [identity] values across all [SkikoFont] subclasses, because the internal
 * registration key is shared under a common `SkikoFont|` prefix.
 *
 * Async loads started by text layout run on the main thread. [FontFamily.Resolver.preload] instead
 * calls [TypefaceLoader.awaitLoad] in the caller's coroutine context, and the loaded typeface is
 * then stored in font caches shared with text layout, which are not thread-safe. Call `preload` for
 * a [FontFamily] containing [SkikoFont]s from the main thread. The [TypefaceLoader] itself may
 * still switch to another dispatcher for I/O or decoding.
 *
 * @param loadingStrategy loading strategy this font will provide in fallback chains
 * @param typefaceLoader a loader that knows how to load this [SkikoFont], may be shared between
 *   several fonts
 * @param variationSettings the settings that will be applied to this font, if supported by the font.
 *   Defaults to empty settings. Prefer passing [FontVariation.Settings] built from [weight] and
 *   [style] (for example `FontVariation.Settings(weight, style)`) when those axes should be applied
 *   to variable fonts.

     * Loader for loading a [SkikoFont] and producing an [org.jetbrains.skia.Typeface].
     *
     * This interface is not intended to be used by application developers for text display. To load
     * a typeface for display use [FontFamily.Resolver].
     *
     * [TypefaceLoader] allows the introduction of new types of font descriptors for use in
     * [FontListFontFamily]. A [TypefaceLoader] allows a new subclass of [SkikoFont] to be used by
     * normal compose text rendering methods.
     *
     * Examples of new types of fonts that [TypefaceLoader] can add:
     * - [FontLoadingStrategy.Blocking] [Font] that loads Typeface from a local resource not
     *   supported by an existing font
     * - [FontLoadingStrategy.OptionalLocal] [Font] that "loads" a platform Typeface only available
     *   on some platforms.
     * - [FontLoadingStrategy.Async] [Font] that loads a font from a backend via a network request.
     *
     * During resolution from [FontFamily.Resolver], a [SkikoFont] subclass will be queried for
     * an appropriate loader.
     *
     * The loader attached to an instance of a [SkikoFont] is only required to be able to load
     * that instance, though it is advised to create one loader for all instances of the same
     * subclass and share them between [SkikoFont] instances to avoid allocations or allow
     * caching.
     *
     * Loaders should return an *unvaried* typeface: [FontVariation.Settings] from the [SkikoFont]
     * are applied by the framework after loading completes.
     *
     * Select the font source from [SkikoFont.identity] (and loader-private fields). Do not branch
     * on [SkikoFont.weight], [SkikoFont.style], or [SkikoFont.variationSettings] to pick different
     * files; those are applied after load for matching and variation cloning.
